# House Rent Prediction

## Project Description

This project aims to predict house rental prices using machine learning. It utilizes various features of a house, such as location, size, amenities, and market trends, to build a model that accurately estimates the rental value.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of house rental listings, which includes features like:

* Location (city, neighborhood)
* Size (square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms)
* Amenities (parking, laundry, pet-friendly)
* Property type (apartment, house, condo)
* Market trends (average rent in the area)

## Methodology

The following steps are involved in the project:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering data from various sources, such as online listings, real estate agencies, and public records.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection:** Choosing the most suitable machine learning algorithm for prediction, such as linear regression, random forest, or gradient boosting.
5. **Model Training:** Training the chosen model on the prepared dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's accuracy using metrics such as R-squared, mean squared error, and root mean squared error.
7. **Deployment:** Making the model available for use in a real-world application, such as a website or mobile app.

## Usage

To use the House Rent Prediction model, you need to provide the following information:

* Location of the property
* Size of the property (square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms)
* Amenities of the property
* Property type

The model will then predict the rental price of the property based on these inputs.
